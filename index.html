Landslide Reporter is an online web application where citizen scientists can 
						submit, view, and analyze information about landslides worldwide from their 
						web browser or mobile device. Reports made with Landslide Reporter detailing 
						when, where, and how a landslide occurred supplement the Global Landslide 
						Catalog (GLC), the largest openly available global database of all rainfall-triggered 
						mass movements since 2007. In a separate application, Landslide Viewer, citizen 
						scientists can view all approved landslide reports on the world map or download 
						the GLC. The GLC currently contains more than 11,000 landslide reports from 
						media sources like news articles and other databases, but it is hard to maintain. 
						Thus, citizen science enables improvement in quality and quantity of the database, 
						resulting in a more robust picture of all landslides around the world. Project 
						launching in early 2018.
